# Third-Party-APIs-Challenge-Work-Day-Scheduler
user story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
acceptance criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist



I created a scheduler that shows the current day and tracks through out the day by each hour. 
green is current and future times
red is current hour
grey means that time has passed

the time plus whatever even is put into the section will be saved within the local storage
